# Microservice-For-Invoice-Processing

A project that was developed as a postgraduate assignment for the master's degree in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence in the subject "AI & Microservices".

The application is implemented in C# with Framework .NET Core 8.0 and Microservice architecture consisting of Data, Service and Controller. As a development tool Visual Studio was chosen. The project concerns the creation of a microservice for invoice processing for a hypothetical company, which covers the basic functions of invoice management (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete). Each invoice includes basic information such as customer name, invoice issue date and total amount. Swagger UI was integrated for easy management and testing of the API via user interface. This allows users to execute requests without having to use external tools such as Postman. The application uses verification mechanisms (DataAnnotations) to ensure that the data entered by users is correct and according to the defined rules (e.g., the invoice amount should be positive). </br> </br>
